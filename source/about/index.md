我的激情所在是打造一家可以传世的公司，这家公司里的人动力十足地创造伟大的产品。其他一切都是第二位的。当然，能赚钱很棒，因为那样你才能够制造伟大的产品。但是动力来自产品，而不是利润。斯卡利本末倒置，把赚钱当成了目标。这种差别很微妙，但它却会影响每一件事：你聘用谁，提拔谁，会议上讨论什么事情。

有些人说：“消费者想要什么就给他们什么。”但那不是我的方式。我们的责任是提前一步搞清楚他们将来想要什么。我记得亨利·福特曾说过，“如果我最初问消费者他们想要什么，他们应该是会告诉我，‘要一匹更快的马！’”人们不知道想要什么，直到你把它摆在他们面前。正因如此，我从不依靠市场研究。我们的任务是读懂还没落到纸面上的东西。

宝丽来的埃德温· 兰德曾谈过人文与科学的交集。我喜欢那个交集。那里有种魔力。有很多人在创新，但创新并不是我事业最主要的与众不同之处。苹果之所以能与人们产生共鸣，是因为在我们的创新中深藏着一种人文精神。我认为伟大的艺术家和伟大的工程师是相似的，他们都有自我表达的欲望。事实上最早做Mac的最优秀的人里，有些人同时也是诗人和音乐家。在20 世纪70 年代，计算机成为人们表现创造力的一种方式。一些伟大的艺术家，像列奥纳多· 达· 芬奇和米开朗基罗，同时也是精通科学的人。米开朗基罗懂很多关于采石的知识，他不是只知道如何雕塑。

人们付钱让我们为他们整合东西，因为他们不能7天24小时地去想这些。如果你对生产伟大的产品有极大的激情，它会推着你去追求一体化，去把你的硬件、软件以及内容管理都整合在一起。你想开辟新的领域，就必须自己来做。如果你想让产品对其他硬件或软件开放，你就只能放弃一些愿景。过去，不同阶段有不同的公司成为了硅谷的典范。很长一段时间里，是惠普。后来，在半导体时代，是仙童和英特尔。我觉得，有一段时间是苹果，后来没落了。而今天，我认为是苹果和谷歌——苹果更多一些。我想苹果已经经受住了时间的检验。它曾有过起起伏伏，但如今仍然走在时代的前沿。

要指出微软的不足很容易。他们显然已经丧失了统治地位，已经变得基本上无关紧要。但是我欣赏他们所做的，也了解那有多么困难。他们很擅长商业方面的事务。他们在产品方面从未有过应有的野心。比尔喜欢把自己说成是做产品的人，但他真的不是。他是个商人。赢得业务比做出伟大的产品更重要。他最后成了最富有的人，如果这就是他的目标，那么他实现了。但那从来都不是我的目标，而且我怀疑，那最终是否是他的目标。我欣赏他，欣赏他创建的公司，很出色，我也喜欢跟他合作。他很聪明，实际上也很有幽默感。但是微软的基因里从来都没有人文精神和艺术气质。即使在看到Mac以后，他们都模仿不好。他们完全没搞懂它是怎么回事儿。

像IBM或微软这样的公司为什么会衰落，我有我自己的见解。这样的公司干得很好，它们进行创新，成为或接近成为某个领域的垄断者，然后产品的质量就变得不那么重要了。这些公司开始重视优秀的销售人员，因为是他们在推动销售、改写了收入数字，而不是产品的工程师和设计师。因此销售人员最后成为公司的经营者。IBM的约翰·埃克斯是聪明、善辩、非常棒的销售人员，但是对产品一无所知。同样的事情也发生在施乐。做销售的人经营公司，做产品的人就不再那么重要，其中很多人就失去了创造的激情。斯卡利加入后，苹果就发生了这样的事情，那是我的失误；鲍尔默接管微软后也是这样。苹果很幸运，能够东山再起，但我认为只要鲍尔默还在掌舵，微软就不会有什么起色。

我讨厌一种人，他们把自己称为“企业家”，实际上真正想做的却是创建一家企业，然后把它卖掉或上市，他们就可以变现，一走了之。他们不愿意费力气打造一家真正的公司，而这正是商业领域里最艰难的工作。只有做到这一点你才能真正有所贡献，为前人留下的遗产添砖加瓦。你要打造一家再过一两代人仍然屹立不倒的公司。那就是沃尔特· 迪士尼，还有休利特和帕卡德，还有创建英特尔的人所做的。他们创造了传世的公司，而不仅仅是赚了钱。这正是我对苹果的期望。

我不认为我对别人很苛刻，但如果谁把什么事搞砸了，我会当面跟他说。诚实是我的责任。我知道我在说什么，而且事实证明通常我是对的。那是我试图创建的文化。我们相互间诚实到残酷的地步，任何人都可以跟我说，他们认为我就是一堆狗屎，我也可以这样说他们。我们有过一些激烈的争吵，互相吼叫，那可以说是我最美好的一段时光。我在别人面前说“罗恩，那个商店看起来像坨屎”的时候没什么不良感觉。或者我会说“天啊，我们真他妈把这个工艺搞砸了”，就当着负责人的面。这就是我们的规矩：你就得超级诚实。也许有更好的方式，像个绅士俱乐部一样，大家都戴着领带，说着上等人的敬语，满嘴华丽委婉的词汇，但是我对此不太在行，因为我是来自加利福尼亚的中产阶级。

我有时候对别人很严厉，可能没有必要那么严厉。我还记得里德6岁时，他回到家，而我那天刚解雇了一个人，我当时就在想，一个人要怎样告诉他的家人和幼子他失业了。很不好受。但是必须有人去做这样的事。我认为确保团队的优秀始终是我的责任，如果我不去做这件事，没有人会去做。

你必须不断地去推动创新。迪伦本来可以一直唱抗议歌曲，可能会赚很多钱，但是他没有那么做。他必须向前走，1965年在民谣中融入电子音乐元素时，他疏远了很多人。1966 年的欧洲巡演是他的巅峰。他会先上台演奏原声吉他，观众非常喜欢。然后他会带出The Band 乐队，他们都演奏电子乐器，观众有时候就会喝倒彩。有一次他正要唱《像一块滚石》，观众中有人高喊“叛徒！”迪伦说：“搞他妈个震耳欲聋！”他们真那样做了。

披头士乐队也一样。他们一直演变、前行、改进他们的艺术。那就是我一直试图做的事情——不断前进。否则，就如迪伦所说，如果你不忙着求生，你就在忙着求死。

我的动力是什么？我觉得，大多数创造者都想为我们能够得益于前人取得的成就而表达感激。我并没有发明我用的语言或数学。我的食物基本都不是我自己做的，衣服更是一件都没做过。我所做的每一件事都有赖于我们人类的其他成员，以及他们的贡献和成就。

我们很多人都想回馈社会，在历史的长河中再添上一笔。我们只能用这种大多数人都掌握的方式去表达——因为我们不会写鲍勃· 迪伦的歌或汤姆· 斯托帕德(Tom Stoppard)的戏剧。我们试图用我们仅有的天分去表达我们深层的感受，去表达我们对前人所有贡献的感激，去为历史长河加上一点儿什么。那就是推动我的力量。

My passion has been to build an enduring company where people were motivated to make great products. Everything else was secondary. Sure, it was great to make a profit, because that was what allowed you to make great products. But the products, not the profits, were the motivation. Sculley flipped these priorities to where the goal was to make money. It's a subtle

difference, but it ends up meaning everything: the people you hire, who gets promoted, what you discuss in meetings. 

Some people say, Give the customers what they want.? But that's not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they are going to want before they do. I think HenryFord once said, If I'd asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, A faster horse!? People don't know what they want until you show it to them. That's why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.

EdwinLand of Polaroid talked about the intersection of the humanities and science. I like that intersection. There's something magical about that place. There are a lot of people innovating, and that's not the main distinction of my career. The reason Apple resonates with people is that There's a deep current of humanity in our innovation. I think great artists and great engineers are similar, in that they both have a desire to express themselves. In fact some of the best people working on the original Mac were poets and musicians on the side. In the seventies computers became a way for people to express their creativity. Great artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were also great at science. Michelangelo knew a lot about how to quarry stone, not just how to be a sculptor.  

People pay us to integrate things for them, because they don't have the time to think about this stuff 24/7. If you have an extreme passion for producing great  products, it pushes you to be integrated, to connect your hardware and your software and content management. You want to break new ground, so you have to do it yourself If you want to allow your products to be open to other hardware or software, you have to give up some of your vision.

At different times in the past, there were companies that exemplified Silicon Valley.It was Hewlett-Packard for a long time. Then, in the semiconductor era, it was Fairchild and Intel. I think that it was Apple for a while, and then that faded. And then today, I think it's Apple and Google? and a little more so Apple. I think Apple has stood the test of time. It's been around for a while, but it's still at the cutting edge of what's going on.

It's easy to throw stones at Microsoft. They've clearly fallen from their dominance.They've become mostly irrelevant. And yet I appreciate what they did and how hard it was. They were very good at the business side of things. They were never as ambitious product-wise as they should have been. Bill likes to portray himself as a man of the product, but he's really not. He's a business person.Winning business was more important than making great products. He ended up the wealthiest guy around, and if that was his goal, then he achieved it. But it's never been my goal, and I wonder, in the end, if it was his goal. I admire him for the company he built, it's impressive and I enjoyed working with him. He's bright and actually has a good sense of humor. But Microsoft never had the humanities and liberal arts in its DNA. Even when they saw the Mac, they couldn't copy it weft. They totally didn't get it.

I have my own theory about why decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The company starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company. John Akers at IBM was a smart, eloquent, fantastic sales person, but he didn't know anything about product. The same thing happened at Xerox. When the sales guys run the company, the product guys don't matter so much, and a lot of them just turn off. It happened at Apple when Sculley came in, which was my fault, and it happened when Ballmer took over at Microsoft. Apple was lucky and it rebounded, but I don't think anything will change at Microsoft as long as Ballmer is running it.

I hate it when people call themselves entrepreneurs? when what they're really trying to do is launch a startup and then sell or go public, so they can cash in and move on. They're unwilling to do the work it takes to build a real company, which is the hardest work in business. That's how you really make a contribution and add to the legacy of those who went before. You build a company that will still stand for something a generation or two from now. That's what Walt Disney did, andHewlett and Packard, and the people who built Intel. They created a company to last, not just to make money. That's what I want Apple to be.

I don't think I run roughshod over people, but if something sucks, I tell people to their face. It's my job to be honest. I know what I'm talking about, and I usually turn out to be right. That's the culture I tried to create. We are brutally honest with each other, and anyone can tell me they think I am full of shit andI can tell them the same. And we've had some rip-roaring arguments, where we are yelling at each other, and it's some of the best times I've ever had. I feel totally comfortable saying Ron, that store looks like shit? in front of everyone else. Or I might say God, we really fucked up the engineering on this?in front of the person that's responsible. That's the ante for being in the room: You've got to be able to be super honest. Maybe there's a better way, a gentlemen's club where we aft wear ties and speak in this Brahmin language and velvet code-words, but I don't know that way, because I am middle class from California.

I was hard on people sometimes, probably harder than I needed to be. I remember the time when Reed was six years old, coming home, and I had just fired somebody that day, and I imagined what it was like for that person to tell his family and his young son that he had lost his job. It was hard. But Somebody's got to do it. I figured that it was always my job to make sure that the team was excellent, and if I didn't do it, nobody was going to do it.

You always have to keep pushing to innovate. Dylan could have sung protest songs forever and probably made a lot of money, but he didn't. He had to move on, and when he did, by going electric in 1965, he alienated a lot of people. His 1966Europe tour was his greatest. He would come on and do a set of acoustic guitar, and the audiences loved him. Then he brought out what became The Band, and they would aft do an electric set, and the audience sometimes booed. There was one point where he was about to sing Like a Roiling Stone? and someone from the audience yells Judas!? And Dylan then says, Play it fucking loud!? And they did. The Beatles were the same way. They kept evolving, moving, refining their art. That's what I've always tried to do-deep moving. Otherwise, as Dylan says, if you're not busy being born, you're busy dying.

What drove me? I think most creative people want to express appreciation for being able to take advantage of the work that's been done by others before us. I didn't invent the language or mathematics I use. I make little of my own food, none of my own clothes. Everything I do depends on other members of our species and the shoulders that we stand on. And a lot of us want to contribute something back to our species and to add something to the flow. It's about trying to express something in the only way that most of us know how-because we can't write Bob Dylan songs or Tom Stoppard plays. We try to use the talents we do have to express our deep feelings, to show our appreciation of aft the contributions that came before us, and to add something to that flow. That's what has driven me.
